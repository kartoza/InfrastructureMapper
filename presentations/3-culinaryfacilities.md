## ❓ Analysis Problem

* How can we determine culinary facilities that are reachable within a specific travel time from a starting point?
* Which culinary facilities that can be reached within 8 minutes and offer the best combination of **low price**, **high ratings**, specific **facilities** like Wi-Fi and indoor seating, and specific **category** like Cafe/Bakery?

## 🔬 Further Research

If I had more time, I would:

* Develop a specific travel mode for motorcycles to better represent real conditions, possibly using custom routing technology.
* Improve the model so users can select facilities and categories using dropdowns connected to the lookup table, ensuring updates are reflected automatically.
* Increase the study area and collect more data to improve the analysis.
