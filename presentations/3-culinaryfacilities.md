## 👩‍💻 About Me

* Intern at **Kartoza**
* Bachelor of Engineering, majored in Geodetic Engineering
* Exploring (open source) GIS

## 🍽️ Why Culinary Mapping?

* Food = lifestyle
* Many spots still unmapped
* GIS shows access with isochrones
* Support better choices

---

## ❓ Analysis Problem

* Which places can be reached within 1 to 10 mins?
* Which ones have low price, high rating, Wi-Fi, indoor seating, are Cafes/Bakeries, reachable within 8 mins?
