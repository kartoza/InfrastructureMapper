## About Me

![bg  left](../img/interns/lindie-strijdom.webp)

* Intern at **Kartoza**
* Background in spatial analysis
* Passionate about data-driven decision making and map design

---

## Analysis Problem

* What’s the shortest route between two points?
* Which roads need repair?

---

## Why These Problems?

Poor road conditions near my home inspired me to analyze routes and identify problem areas.

## The Workflow

## Collection Results

* 108 points
* 139 lines
* 1,9 km² study area

---

## Methodology

---

## Results - 1

### Shortest distance analysis

* ~1,2 km travel distance
* ~2 min travel time

---

## Results - 2

### Road condition

* 24% in need of repair

![bg left](../img/roads-results-2.png)

---

## Insights

* 30 segments need repair (~2,6 km total)
* 3 segments critical (~639 m total)

---

## Recommendation

* Fully reconstruct Burg Street
* Partially repair Berg Street

---

## Further Research

If I had more time, I would:

* Use more advanced networking tools (pgRouting)
* Digitize bridge and speed bump features
* Increase the study area

---

## My Internship Experience

### Highlights

* ✅ Learned to use QGIS and multiple other software/tools
* 🤝 Collaborated on a real project and gained experience
* 🎯 Gained confidence in presenting and communication
* 💬 Learned effective time management

---

## Other Projects
